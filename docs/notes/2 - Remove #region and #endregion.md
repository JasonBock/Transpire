TODO:
* If `#endregion` is at the end of the file...I might need to remove whitespace, like `n + 1`, maybe
* The docs for TRANS11 don't match the error condition that's in code...why?
* Side note: I may need to up my documentation game on all of this.
* The URL reporting may need some encoding love
* Create a task to create a refactoring to reorganize a given class to be "neater"
