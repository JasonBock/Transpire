# Numbers should use digit separators

## Issue

Defining literals without separators can make it difficult to read what its' exact size is - e.g. `42315483`. Adding separators make it easier to see the number's size - e.g. `42_315_483`.

## Code Fix

A code fix is available that will add separators.
